    "Motivation\n",
    "It‚Äôs useful for a brand to know a beauty blogger‚Äôs birthday so that they can do timely birthday-specific outreach. For example, brands can engage some of their top bloggers with gift makeup sets. \n",

    "-\n",
    "We would like for you to visualize and explore our social media posts data, with a focus on the posts that mention the words ‚Äúmy birthday.‚Äù Here are some questions to guide your exploration. There is no need to answer all or any of these questions if you want to explore the data in another way. \n",
    "How many birthday posts does a user post on average? If a user posts multiple posts, are they all clustered around a certain month or day?\n",
    "How are birthday mentions different across different channels?\n",
    "How many birthday mentions indicate an age? (i.e. ‚Äúmy 30th birthday‚Äù)\n",
    "Develop a way to guess a user‚Äôs birth date (month and/or day and/or year) using this text data.\n",
    "What are some common themes in these birthday posts? (Are they about cake, gifts, resolutions, or something else?)\n",
    "As you begin exploring the data, remember to record your thought process and show your work in some way (i.e. Jupyter notebook, d3.js, etc). \n",
    "Data\n",
